# C Programming Projects

Welcome to the C Programming Projects repository! This repository contains a collection of projects, exercises, and problem solutions implemented using the C programming language. It is organized into the following folders:

## [C Language Basic](./C%20Language%20Basic)

The `C Language Basic` folder contains projects and exercises aimed at beginners who are learning the fundamentals of the C programming language. It covers topics such as variables, control structures, functions, arrays, and basic input/output operations. Each project or exercise within this folder is designed to reinforce your understanding of these core concepts.

## [C Problems](./C%20Problems)

The `C Problems` folder consists of a variety of programming problems and challenges that will help you strengthen your problem-solving skills in C. These problems range from simple to complex, covering different areas of programming such as algorithms, data structures, string manipulation, mathematical operations, and more. Each problem is provided with a description and, in some cases, example inputs and outputs to guide your implementation.

## [Codeforces Problems](./Codeforces%20Problems)

The `Codeforces Problems` folder contains solutions to programming problems sourced from the Codeforces platform. Codeforces is a popular online competitive programming platform that hosts contests and provides a vast array of problems to solve. The solutions in this folder are categorized by the contest or problem ID and are intended to showcase various techniques and strategies used to solve programming challenges.

## [Lab Project](./Lab%20Project)

The `Lab Project` folder contains a specific project or assignment that you were assigned to complete as part of a lab or coursework. This project may involve multiple files, requirements, and instructions provided by your instructor or supervisor. Make sure to review the project-specific README file within this folder for the necessary guidelines and details.

## Usage

To explore the projects and exercises within each folder, simply click on the respective folder name above. Once inside a folder, you can review the README file associated with each project. The README file will provide instructions, explanations, and any necessary setup or dependencies required to run the code. Make sure you have a C compiler installed on your system.

Feel free to modify and experiment with the code in this repository to further enhance your understanding of C programming concepts. You can also use the projects and problem solutions as references or starting points for your own C programming endeavors.
