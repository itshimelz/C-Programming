# Lab Project: Student Grade Management System

Welcome to the Lab Project folder! This folder contains the code and resources for the "Student Grade Management System" project, which was developed as part of the 1st-semester lab project.

## Project Description

The "Student Grade Management System" is a C program designed to manage student grades and provide basic functionality for storing, retrieving, and analyzing grade information. The program allows for the creation of student records, entering grades for different subjects, calculating averages, and generating reports.

## File Structure

The project folder structure is as follows:


- `student_grade_management_system.c`: This is the main C source code file that implements the student grade management system. It contains the program logic and functionality.
- `README.md`: This README file provides information about the project, its purpose, and usage instructions.

## Usage

To use the Student Grade Management System, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have a C compiler installed on your system.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the "Lab Project" folder.
